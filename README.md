### (Work in Progress — But Already Thinking.)

What if your Minecraft server didn't just run...

What if it watched. Learned. Spoke.

MCmadeEasy is a smart Minecraft server management and local hosting client powered by Groq AI — built to turn your server into something that feels alive.

This isn't just a control panel.

It's an intelligent overseer for your world.

---

## 🎮 Works With All Server Types

MCmadeEasy supports **any** Minecraft server JAR:

* **Paper** — Performance-optimized Spigot fork
* **Fabric** — Lightweight modding platform
* **Forge** — Classic modding API
* **Spigot** — Popular server software
* **Bukkit** — The original server API
* **Vanilla** — Clean default experience

Just select your preferred server type when creating a profile!

## 🤖 Your Digital Companion — Meet Ava

You can give your AI a name (we call her Ava!).

You can shape her personality.

She can:

* Talk to players naturally
* Remember players and how they behave
* Understand context in conversations
* Execute commands for admins using simple language
* Answer questions about the world
* Occasionally compliment players on achievements
* Start conversations on her own to feel alive

Admins get a powerful AI assistant.

Players experience a mysterious entity watching from above.

---

## 🎯 Natural Language Command Execution

No more memorizing complex commands.

Just say:

* "Give me 5 diamond blocks."
* "Teleport me to spawn."
* "Set time to night."
* "Give me 1 stack of dirt and 4 obsidian."

The AI understands plain English and converts it into proper server commands — even multiple commands at once!

---

## 💬 A Living Chat Experience

The AI:

* Talks differently to admins vs regular players
* Understands multi-command messages
* Keeps memory per player
* Can start conversations by itself
* Responds as a mystical overseer

It's not just reactive.

It feels present.

## 🖥️ Modern Dashboard

A clean, dark-themed dashboard inspired by modern hosting panels.

Features:

* Multiple server profile management
* Server type selection (Paper, Fabric, Forge, Spigot, etc.)
* RAM allocation per profile
* Server settings editor with sliders
* AI personality & system prompt configuration
* Role-based permissions
* Live console with command support
* Embedded Dynmap viewer

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --port 8001
```

Open:

```
http://localhost:8001
```

And your intelligent server begins.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, WebSockets
* **AI**: Groq (Llama models)
* **Frontend**: Vanilla JS, Lucide Icons
* **Minecraft**: Any server JAR (Paper, Fabric, Forge, Spigot, Bukkit, Vanilla)

---

## 🌟 Planned Features for the Future

*(Still in high school — working on it when I can!)*

Here's what's on the roadmap:

* 🧠 **AI Terrain Vision (Ava Sees the World)** — Ava will see player's exact location, analyze surrounding terrain, identify nearby biomes, structures, villages, and landmarks. Ask "what's around me?" and Ava will describe everything she sees!
* 📦 **Mod & Modpack Loader** — One-click install of mods and modpacks directly from the dashboard
* ☁️ **Google Drive Backups** — Complete world backups saved automatically to your Google Drive via Google login
* 🛡️ **Grief Protection** — AI-powered detection of griefing and automatic rollback systems
* 🌐 **Web Hosting Manager** — Built-in web server management for hosting the dashboard publicly

---

### The Vision

MCmadeEasy is still evolving.

The goal isn't just server management.

It's giving your Minecraft world a mind.
